                    In my honest opinion, this has been one of the best movies released in the last 10 or so years. Oppenheimer does an awesome job of keeping everyone in the theatre glued to the screen. If you want a suspense packed movie that will have you anxiously waiting for what comes next then this is it. Not only is the drama and suspense in this movie the best, but it is produced so perfectly.

                    It had some of the best cinematic scenes I have seen in a long, long time, while keeping it very realistic and not over the top. On-top of everything else I love how Oppenheimer portrayed the history that went down during the time this took place and was very historically accurate. Overall this was one of the best films I have ever watched, produced amazingly and packed with an awesome cast.

                    Cillian Murphy is also the best drama/suspenful actors there is.

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order for the black and white sections of the movie to be shot in the same quality as the rest of the film, Kodak produced a limited supply of their Double-X black and white film stock in 70mm. This film stock was chosen specifically for its heritage - it was originally sold to photographers as Super-XX during World War II, and was very popular with photojournalists of the era.</li>
                        
                        <li>Albert Einstein is shown walking in the woods with Kurt GÃ¶del. The two of them did actually take long walks together, as friends at the Institute for Advanced Studies.</li>
                        
                        <li>Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid) is shown playing bongos multiple times during the film. In addition to his skills in physics, Feynman was known as a prolific bongo player.</li>
